# Vidify

## Want to have a better online learning experience? Need to revisit a lecture video and don't want to spend time going back and forth at exactly that part of video where you are interested in? This will save you those efforts!

Our solution, VIDIFY, is powered by Azure Cognitive Services to make the learning experience richer. We provide a one shop stop for remote learning/remote instruction integrated into Microsoft Teams. You can create a tab in your teams channel which plays the video, displays insights, enlists keywords/topics/entities along with search results for the relevant words, and answers questions from the knowledge base. Welcome to a new learning experience, made smarter by Azure!
